Below is a social engennering scam I built as a proof of concept. I did not put tags on this repository and I did not put stars on it because I just wanted people I linkted to it to see it, but somehow other people found it and multiple people (Like 5 legitamate people and one troll) ran the code despite the discord warnings saying not to. `nitro.js` contains the code that was originally here, and `unobfusicated.js` contains what the code actually does in plain-text.
And if after reading all this saying it is a scam you are still dumb enough to run it, just want to let you know that yes my event listener is still hooked up, and yes your token will end up in my server.

# Discord-Nitro-Hack

## ======

## Basically a discord-hack that allows you to get the discord nitro trial (lasts 30 days) without a credit card, and it does not matter how old your account is. 

## ======

To run, just copy the code from `nitro.js`, paste it into the console, and run. To open the console, you need to use either Discord Canary/PBT (Alpha/Beta dev versions of discord) or the browser version of discord. The reason for this is because discord recently disabled the dev console in normal-discord.

Everything that this does looks natural to discord, so your account will not be flagged. Multiple users have already used this and have not been banned.


###### P.S. Please do not star this, I do not want very many people to find it. If it starts getting stars I will delete it.
