Below is a social engineering scam I built as a proof of concept. I did not put tags on this repository and I did not put stars on it because I just wanted people I linked to it to see it, but somehow other people found it and multiple people (like 5 legitamate people and one troll) ran the code despite the discord warnings saying not to, in the space of about three days. `nitro.js` contains the code that was originally here, and `unobfusicated.js` contains what the code actually does in plain-text.

It would be super easy to add in a self bot to this script and make the infected user send a custom message to every channel of every server and all their freinds, promoting this repository. Turning this into a discord-spread-worm virus, and filling my private channel with tokens.  

I'm leaving this up both to let others know about the risks, and because it would possibly look good on a resume in the future.


## -------- Original ReadMe: ---------

# Discord-Nitro-Hack

## ======

## Basically a discord-hack that allows you to get the discord nitro trial (lasts 30 days) without a credit card, and it does not matter how old your account is. 

## ======

To run, just copy the code from `nitro.js`, paste it into the console, and run. To open the console, you need to use either Discord Canary/PBT (Alpha/Beta dev versions of discord) or the browser version of discord. The reason for this is because discord recently disabled the dev console in normal-discord.

Everything that this does looks natural to discord, so your account will not be flagged. Multiple users have already used this and have not been banned.


###### P.S. Please do not star this, I do not want very many people to find it. If it starts getting stars I will delete it.
###### P.P.S. You are welcome to star this, that was just part of what it said for the scam.
